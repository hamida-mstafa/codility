/*
  In this Kata, you will be given 2 or more arrays of integers, both positive and negative. Your task is to find the maximum product that can be formed by taking one element from each array.

  For example:
  solve([[1, 2],[3, 4]]) = 8, given by 2 * 4
  solve([[10,-15],[-1,-3]]) = 45, given by (-15) * (-3)
  More examples in test cases. Good luck!

  Don't forget to rate and rank! */
